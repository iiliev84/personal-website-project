Personal Website Project

Part1:
"Create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository.

üè† Home Page 
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

üë§ About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

üñºÔ∏è Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is a place to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web." Copied from project assignment.
